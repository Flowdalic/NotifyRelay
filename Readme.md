# Notify to Jabber

![Logo](app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

Send all Android text notifications to a xmpp jabber account. I
use [smack](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/) lib for this.

Alternative: use your [gotify server](https://github.com/gotify/server) and an application token to
submit the notifications. I use the [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) lib for the REST request.
